# PHPCS Standards - The XpBar edition

These are my personal phpcs standards.

All you should need to get started is the install script; simply

1. Clone the Repo
2. cd into the directory
3. run `./install`


Then enjoy!

You can find the accompanying zsh functions, `koolaid`, [here](https://github.com/xp-bar/.files/blob/master/.koolaid)
